# ctrl

The minimalist note-keeper automatically saves your notes in your browser, so you never have to worry about losing your important ideas.

## Disclaimer

I wrote the code for this a very long time ago, and I would like to completely rewrite it. The notes are stored in your browser in `sessionStorage`, so clearing your browser history will clear your notes. Don't use this tool for anything important, in other words. I don't know if there's a bunch of bugs right now, but I'm uploading this project anyway to showcase my passion for building things! :-)

## Why did I make this?

I've tried a bunch of different note-keepers, and liked none of them. One of the more minimalist tools called Bear is a paid service, and simple tools like Notepad don't offer very good organising structures. So I set out to build the perfect tool for myself, allowing me to organise notes into folders, save them in my browser and make `.txt` backups to my computer, all while keeping the design and usability very simple. Two features that meant a lot to me was having word and character count being visible at all times, and being able to quickly search to find what I needed.

## What did I learn?

I learned that you can do a lot without a database, if you trust your data to `sessionStorage`. For important data I wouldn't recommend doing so, but for quickly prototyping a blog post or writing a song lyric it served my purposes. This project gave me experience with developing a full product, from concept to design and then code, and relying on my own sensibilities to determine what a good editor should feel like. I went through a lot of iterations while building ctrl, which taught me the value of trying out different things and seeing what sticks. Do I want icons? Do I want a hacker design? Do I want to make it more simple? Do I want it to be customisable or barebones? I didn't know at first, but that's the beauty. You don't need to get it right the first time.
